# 环衬（一）

Words behind works. April to May.

> And Some Afterwords.
>
> 四月末到五月大概就单独开了 CcVLogos 和 CcThu 两个公开项目。

> ~~虽然 CcThu 开始也是在 gitlab 上面，直到五月中下旬才迁移到 github。~~

## About [CcVLogos](https://github.com/chillcicada/CcVLogos)

## About [CcThu](https://github.com/chillcicada/ccthu)

### Inspiration

This project was originally made for the [cTodo](https://github.com/chillcicada/ctodo), for the reason that the original THU-Learn-Lib and Thu-Info-Lib (Hereinafter referred to as Lib) are too large for a simple plugin (In fact, the `cheerio` is considered as a server package. In other words, we build a local server when using them) and they are not well compatible and efficient. So I decided to build a new API server that can be easily used in any project.

Other main reason is that I need an api server, not just an api lib. Finally I decide to make an independent project.

As you may gauss, this project has referred many of the Thu-Learn-Lib and Thu-Info-Lib, and I have set them as the co-contributors of this project, :).

### Afterwords

Maybe you have notice that the mini project is released under the GPL-3.0-only license. Yep, after i considered that this might make adverse impact on the competition between students, I've decided to force this part of this to be open sourced by users and modders (although this is more of a moral requirement).

My original intention is to serve myself and serve everyone at the same time. The resources available are simply terrible as you can see. I have no intention / requirement of caring about competition.

## 其他

大部分私有仓库相关的内容就不讲了。

### [typst-dotenv](https://github.com/chillcicada/typst-dotenv)

代码没什么好讲的，二十行解决。

### MathPractice

五一的时候想了一下，决定把所有学校课程相关的代码全部迁移到一个 monorepo，即 [MySchoolwork](https://github.com/chillcicada/MySchoolwork)，不幸的是这个项目目前托管在 gitlab 上，github 上会做一点调整，并计划于每次学期末更新一次，同时也很在本学期期末重新作为公开仓库。
